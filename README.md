    Dump OpenFOAM matrix to mtx format (experimental)
  </p>
</div>



## About the Project

This is an experimental sub-project to dump OpenFOAM lduMatrix to matrix market format, which does not yet take into account of certain boundary conditions, but is sufficient as a training dataset. Figure [1](#figure-1) shows the mixing elbow case that comes with the icoFoam solver, and Figure [2](#figure-2) shows a visualization of the dumped $U_x$ matrix at the first time step.

The following OpenFOAM versions are currently supported:

- OpenFOAM-7
- OpenFOAM-8
- OpenFOAM-9
- OpenFOAM-10
