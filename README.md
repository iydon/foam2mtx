    Dump OpenFOAM matrix to mtx format (experimental)
  </p>
</div>



## About the Project

This is an experimental sub-project to dump OpenFOAM matrix to matrix market format, which does not yet take into account boundary conditions, but is sufficient as a training set. Figure 1 shows the mixing elbow case that comes with the icoFoam solver, and Figure 2 shows a visualization of the dump Ux matrix at the first time step.

The following OpenFOAM versions are currently supported:

- OpenFOAM-7
- OpenFOAM-8
- OpenFOAM-9
- OpenFOAM-10
